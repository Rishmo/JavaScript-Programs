## Introduction

This repository is a resource for anyone looking to learn JavaScript or improve their skills in this versatile programming language. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your knowledge of more advanced topics, you'll find useful examples and code snippets here.

### What You'll Learn:
- Basic JavaScript syntax and concepts
- Functions, loops, and control structures
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Asynchronous JavaScript and promises
- Advanced data structures and algorithms

## Programs

This repository is organized into different folders based on the difficulty level of the programs.

### Basic Programs
These are beginner-level programs aimed at understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript.

- `helloWorld.js`: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `fibonacci.js`: A function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
- `factorial.js`: A program to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.
- `palindrome.js`: A program to check if a string is a palindrome.

### Intermediate Programs
These programs introduce more complex topics such as object manipulation, error handling, and working with external APIs.

- `arrayMethods.js`: Demonstrates the use of common array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
- `promiseExample.js`: Shows how to handle asynchronous operations using promises.
- `APIfetch.js`: Fetches data from a public API and displays it.
- `objectDestructuring.js`: A demonstration of how to use object destructuring to simplify your code.

### Advanced Programs
These are more complex projects that involve algorithm design, advanced JavaScript features, or real-world applications.

- `todoApp.js`: A basic to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.
- `sortingAlgorithms.js`: An implementation of common sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.).
